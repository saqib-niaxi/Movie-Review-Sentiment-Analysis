# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Goal
This project builds a sentiment analysis system to classify movie reviews from the IMDb dataset as either **positive** or **negative**. The aim is to help understand public sentiment using machine learning techniques.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**

- Contains thousands of movie reviews labeled as `positive` or `negative`.
- Ideal for natural language processing and text classification tasks.

---

## ðŸ§¹ Text Preprocessing
The reviews were cleaned and transformed using:
- Lowercasing
- Removing stopwords
- Tokenization
- Lemmatization (optional)
- Vectorization using TF-IDF

---

## ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models
The following models were trained and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression
- NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
To measure the model performance:
- **Accuracy**
- **F1-Score**
- Confusion Matrix (visualized)

---

## ðŸ§  Optional Feature
A basic user interface (text input) where users can enter a movie review and get real-time sentiment prediction by the model.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualizations)
